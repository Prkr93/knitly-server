# Knitly Server

## Background

This server was built for my showcase project, Knitly, that I completed at my time at Turing. Created using a basic Express server.

This server allows you to view some pre-saved patterns, as well as save your own!

## To Run

- Clone down this server.
- Run `npm i`
- Run `nodemon server.js`
- You can then view inspirations or save your own at [Knitly Knitting](https://knitly-knitting.surge.sh/)
